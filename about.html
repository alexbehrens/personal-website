    <h2>Hi I'm Alex</h2>
     <p>I am a developer and recent graduate of Tulane University. I love startups, systems thinking, and space.</p>

 <div class="aboutblock">
  <h1>Past</h1>
  <p>I grew up in the Bay Area, responsible for my interest in technology and making me an Apple fanboy at a young age. I began my college career at Tulane University studying neuroscience, then switching to business, and finally to political economy. While in college I worked a handful of startups and at Stanford Medicine, giving me wide range of experiences. In college, I discovered a love of systems thinking focusing on investigating modern day propaganda machines (Russia's American campaign and China's now infamous subjection of Uyghurs).

 <h2>Present</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently working as a Fellow at DigitalDx Ventures, a firm investing in diverse founders in the AI diagnosis space. I wear a lot of hats and have done everything from fundraising to software development. Earlier in the year I finally got the hang of programming (the 3rd intro to Python class was the charm!) and haven't looked back since. On the side, I am taking a JavaScript course, trying my hand at building NLP solutions and creating computer vision projects in Python.

 <h2>Future</h2>
 <p>
  In the next few months I hope to become proficient enough in programming to design full stack solutions. I want to continue studying behavioral economics, human centered design and ethical gamification in digital products. In the near future, I hope to work at a string of early stage companies and start a few myself. Long term, I would love to work in venture capital, investing in bleeding edge technology and inspiring founders.

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>
  Some of my favorite long tail interests are longevity research, synthetic biology, soft robotics, space travel & infrastructure, combatting misinformation, and decentralization. In my spare time I love to hike, ski, and create art.
